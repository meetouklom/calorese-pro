            </center>
            <p>This tool is designed to help you calculate the number of calories you should consume each day, based on
                your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). It is highly recommended
                for those who want to lose weight, maintain a healthy lifestyle, or manage their daily calorie intake
                effectively.

            <h1>What is BMR?</h1>
        </center>
        <p>BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the amount of energy your body needs to perform basic life-sustaining
            functions—such as breathing, circulating blood, and maintaining body temperature—while at complete
            rest. Knowing your BMR helps you understand how much energy your body uses just to stay alive, even
            without physical activity.

            <h1>What is TDEE?</h1>
        </center>
        <p><strong>TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is the total amount of energy you burn in a day. It
                includes:</strong>

            • Your BMR <br>
            • Plus the calories burned from daily activities and exercise <br><br>

            <strong>TDEE helps you estimate how many calories you should consume each day to:</strong><br>
            • Maintain your current weight <br>
            • Lose weight <br>
            • Gain weight, depending on your goals
